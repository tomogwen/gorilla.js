Gorilla Enclosure Simulator in two.js and chart.js

The number on the heat map represents a randomised 'desirability' of the contents of that square. The gorillas move about the enclosure based on which square they'd like to be in. It then generates a heat map of where gorillas spend the most time and a graph of desirability against normalised time spent.
